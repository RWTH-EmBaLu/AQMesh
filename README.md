# AQMesh - API
Three AQ Mesh air quality measuring devices by Environmental Instruments Ltd were installed for the EmBaLu research project at RWTH Aachen University on emission-based ventilation control in road tunnels. The aim of the research project is to reduce the operating costs of the Einhorn Tunnel in Schwäbisch Gmünd by measuring pollutants in situ and regulating the tunnel ventilation accordingly. This API was created for automated retrieval of the measured pollutant concentrations.
